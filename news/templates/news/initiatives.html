                    <p class="pt-2">SPNA believes that early year’s childcare is part of the full spectrum of the educational journey from birth to adulthood. 
                        Children do not start their journey when they walk through the school gates on their first day
                         they have been on their journey since the day they were born, and their parents have been on the journey for even longer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Early years childcare is not simply baby-sitting. This is true no matter what sort of nursery a child attends,
                         whether it is private, Local Authority, or child minding. Settings are regulated by the Care Inspectorate, 
                         while our staff are regulated by the Scottish Social Services Council.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">In the recent report into the importance of early years, the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood noted that 
                        “the time from pregnancy to five…fundamentally shape our whole lives”. The Duchess of Cambridge is quoted as saying 
                        “the early years are not simply about how we raise our children. They are about the society we will become.”</p>

                            <p>The study of human development is a rich and varied subject. We all have personal experience with development, 
                                but it is sometimes difficult to understand how and why people grow, learn, and act as they do.

                                Various theories focus on trying to explain how children change and grow over the course of childhood. 
                                These theories centre on various aspects of development including social, emotional, and cognitive growth.

                    <p class="pt-2">There can almost be no greater change to the lives of parents than when their children are born. For many, 
                        it is a time of low sleep, high stress, and complete and utter love, devotion, and wonderment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">It can also be a period of isolation, loneliness, and bewilderment, especially for first time, young, or single parents.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">For those parents with children under the age of three, and who cannot afford childcare, especially when they are out of work, 
                        cannot work, or are studying, both the parent and the child will all too frequently miss out on the fundamental support and advice which childcare staff provide. 
                        The mental health and wellbeing of these parents and children can suffer enormously, which can have an impact through the rest of their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">
                        SPNA will be looking to partner with Government, Local Authorities, and charities and social enterprises to ensure that all parents understand
                         and receive all the support which they need and deserve.
