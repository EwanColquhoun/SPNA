                    <p class="pt-2">Nurseries should provide a nurturing and rich environment where children can play, learn, and start their development into becoming healthy, aware, curious, kind, and caring people.
                        Scottish Private Nurseries Association (SPNA) is a grass-roots membership organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2"> We are run, managed, and funded by owners and managers of private,
                        voluntary and independent nurseries, and we educate and advocate in a meaningful and positive approach on behalf of the sector and the children in Scotland.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2"> While some nurseries closed their doors, many of our PVI nurseries continued to provide care for the children of front-line workers: our NHS nurses, doctors, ambulance staff, 
                        all the way through to supermarket staff. However, the sector had to push for the recognition and additional funding needed to sustain the provision of this crucial service.

                <div>
                    <p class="pt-2">Across Scotland, around 50% of the children who attend nursery do so in private, independent, voluntary, or not-for-profit nurseries.
                        In Glasgow and Edinburgh, more than half of children in nursery attend a non-Local Authority nursery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">SPNA wants to ensure that all private nurseries can provide the best quality childcare at affordable rates for parents. 
                        We want to see all of the children in our care unfold to their full potential, we want to continue to provide support and advice to the parents, 
                        and we want to recognise the value and talent of our workforce.

                    <p class="pt-2">The COVID pandemic has shown how vital our sector is. While nurseries in other sectors closed their doors, 
                        many of our nurseries continued to provide care for the children of front-line workers our NHS nurses, doctors, ambulance staff, all the way through to supermarket staff.

                        As society and the economy continues to recover, our settings will be called on even more to deliver the care for children as parents return to 
                        their traditional workplaces away from home or undertake study and training to move into new employment.
