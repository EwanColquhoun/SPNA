                    <p class="pt-2">While working at Edinburgh Airport, and especially when she was on shift work, Sharon struggled to find good quality, 
                        formal child-care for her young children, in an area which was convenient for her work patterns. She opened her first child-care centre, 
                        Little Flyers at Ingliston, in 1999, and has since grown the business to include 3 other Early Years settings, plus 4 out-of-hours care for school aged children.
                         Recognising the difficulties of sourcing high-quality staff at short notice, Sharon has also opened a recruitment company for nursery careworkers
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-2">Sharon is passionate that all children should be recognised as individuals and supported from the very start of their wee lives to become confident and great achievers. 
                        She believes this starts with learning-through-play, as well as care and nurturing, which continues through-out their childcare journey.
                         Her husband and children have dyslexia undiagnosed until too late and so did not have the best experience through their education system.
                          Sharon still believes in continually improving standards in all of her settings, and has the ambition to achieve this over all Early Years providers,
                           which makes her proud to be part of children's early learning.
